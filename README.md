# Mario-Game
Hello everybody, I show you again a new version of my game. there are a lot of news features : 
 - A menu
 - Correction of some problems
 - New background
 - And the programme has been really changed for a best reading of the code (I made 3 classes)
 - 
I don't know if I will continue the creation of my game because I have no idea of what I can do more for my game, but I will continue to patch some problems. If you try to launch my program, you will see that the mario, blocks, buttons etc ... won't be at the good place. It's because we don't have the same screen so you need to adjust the coordonnees and the size of your window in fonction of your screen. (if you know how to do not have this problem again please told me how to do : edouardvinc@protonmail.ch)
Don't hesitate to install my program and to launch it, goodbye !

Made with python 3.9.5, pygame.
