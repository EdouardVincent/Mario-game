# Maybe-the-last-version-of-the-Mario-game
Hello everybody, I show you again a new version of my game. there are a lot of news features : 
 - A menu
 - Correction of some problems
 - New background
 - And the programme has been really changed for a best readinf of the code (I did a class "objet", object in english)
Except the bricks images, you can find the other images like the different pictures of Mario in the previous publications. I don't know if I will continue the creation of my game because I have no idea of what I can do more for my game. If you try to launch my program, you will see that the mario, blocks, buttons ... won't be at the good place. It's because we don't have the same screen so you need to adjust the coordonnees and the size of your window in fonction of your screen.
Don't hesitate to install my program and to launch it, goodbye !
